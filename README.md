#Asthma Doc
We have started to work this project during our fifth year of education.
This application is designed for android mobile devices and the main purpose is to help people with asthma and breath health problems.
The App give to the user to: 
- Create record of his mood/symptom 
- Have a basic mood/symptom forecast
- Check humidity, temperature and allergens levels
Note: The app is under development.
Disclaimer: AsthmaDoc does not intend to substitute drugs or doctor's advice in anyway.
